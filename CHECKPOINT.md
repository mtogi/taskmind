# TaskMind Development Checkpoint - June 10, 2025

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented a robust frontend application for TaskMind with offline capabilities. The application now works even when the backend server is not available or experiencing issues. This document summarizes our latest changes and current standing.

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Authentication System Enhancements

- Fixed the "Use Test Account" button on the login page to work without requiring backend connectivity
- Implemented a mock authentication system that simulates backend responses
- Created a dedicated test login page at `/test-login` for easy testing
- Updated the auth hook to handle test account login seamlessly

### 2. Mock API Implementation

- Created a comprehensive mock API system in `lib/mock-api.ts`
- Implemented mock user data and authentication functions
- Added mock task data for dashboard testing
- Updated the main API utilities to fall back to mock implementations when backend is unavailable
- Improved error handling to better detect connection issues

### 3. File Encoding Issues Fixed

- Fixed encoding issues in dashboard and other TypeScript files
- Created utility script `find-encoding-issues.ps1` to detect encoding problems
- Recreated problematic files with proper encoding
- Improved file handling to prevent future encoding issues

### 4. Additional Improvements

- Updated API error handling with better typing
- Improved TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Added fallback for task data in the dashboard
- Updated documentation to reflect current progress
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

## Current Application Features

The application now provides the following features:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Regular login/registration with API
   - Test account login that works offline
   - Token-based authentication with JWT

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Task overview with statistics
   - Recent tasks display
   - Task completion progress tracking

3. **Task Management**:
   - Task creation and editing
   - Task status updates
   - Task prioritization
   - Calendar view for tasks

4. **User Interface**:
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Light/dark theme support
   - Modern UI components from shadcn/ui
   - Intuitive navigation

5. **Offline Capabilities**:
   - Mock API for testing without backend
   - Graceful error handling for connection issues
   - Fallback data for demonstration purposes

## Known Issues

1. **Backend Connection**: The application may still have connectivity issues with the backend, but these are now mitigated by the mock API system.
2. **Environment Variables**: The backend requires proper environment variables to be set.
3. **Docker Configuration**: Docker Compose setup needs environment variables configuration.
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Some TypeScript errors may still exist, particularly with third-party libraries.

## Next Steps

1. Set up proper PostgreSQL database (either locally or using Docker)
2. Complete backend environment configuration
3. Implement advanced task prioritization algorithm
4. Complete API documentation
5. Set up automated testing

## Technical Notes

- The mock API system is designed for development and testing purposes only
- When deploying to production, ensure the backend is properly configured
- The test account credentials are:
  - Email: test@taskmind.dev
  - Password: testpassword123
- Use the `/test-login` page for quick testing of the application

## Conclusion

The TaskMind application is now more robust and can function independently of the backend server for demonstration and development purposes. This allows for easier development and testing of the frontend features without requiring a fully operational backend environment.
