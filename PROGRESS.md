## Development Status (Last Updated: June 5, 2025)

### Current Environment Status
- Successfully installed frontend dependencies (required `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to date-fns version conflict)
- Successfully installed backend dependencies
- Successfully generated Prisma client from schema
- Attempted to run development environment using multiple methods:
  - Using dev.bat script (launches servers in separate windows)
  - Using Docker Compose (encountered issues with environment variables)
  - Directly using npm scripts

### Issues Encountered
1. **Environment Variables**: Missing .env file for backend with required variables:
   - DATABASE_URL (for PostgreSQL)
   - JWT_SECRET
   - JWT_EXPIRES_IN
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

2. **Docker Configuration**: Docker Compose setup requires environment variables to be configured

### Next Steps for Development
1. Create proper .env file for backend with required configuration
2. Set up PostgreSQL database (either locally or using Docker)
3. Complete running frontend and backend in development mode
4. Test basic functionality like authentication and task management
