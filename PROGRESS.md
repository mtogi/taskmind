## Development Status (Last Updated: June 10, 2025)

### Current Environment Status
- Successfully implemented task list and detail views
- Successfully added calendar view for tasks
- Successfully implemented natural language task input component
- Successfully added email notification system
- Successfully integrated Stripe for subscription management
- Successfully implemented rate limiting and security enhancements
- Successfully added structured logging system
- Successfully implemented mock API system for offline development
- Successfully fixed encoding issues in dashboard and other files
- Successfully fixed authentication with test account functionality
- Environment requires proper configuration of:
  - DATABASE_URL (for PostgreSQL)
  - JWT_SECRET
  - JWT_EXPIRES_IN
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  - Email configuration (EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, etc.)
  - APP_URL
  - ENABLE_SCHEDULER

### Recent Fixes
1. **Authentication**: Fixed test account login functionality to work without backend
2. **Mock API**: Implemented comprehensive mock API system for offline development
3. **File Encoding**: Fixed encoding issues in dashboard and other TypeScript files
4. **Error Handling**: Improved API error handling to better detect connection issues
5. **Testing**: Added dedicated test login page at /test-login for easy testing

### Issues Encountered
1. **Environment Variables**: Missing .env file for backend with required variables
2. **Docker Configuration**: Docker Compose setup requires environment variables to be configured
3. **Type Conflicts**: Some type conflicts with rate limiter middleware need to be resolved
4. **Backend Connection**: Frontend-backend connection issues (mitigated with mock API)

### Next Steps for Development
1. Create proper .env file for backend with required configuration
2. Set up PostgreSQL database (either locally or using Docker)
3. Install required npm packages for new features:
   - `npm install nodemailer cron date-fns express-rate-limit helmet cors hpp express-mongo-sanitize xss-clean express-validator --save --legacy-peer-deps`
4. Run Prisma migrations for updated schema:
   - `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_reminder_sent_field`
