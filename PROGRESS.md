### Major Migration Completed ✅
**Database Migration from Prisma to Supabase PostgreSQL**

We have successfully completed a major migration from Prisma ORM to direct PostgreSQL with Supabase:

#### What Was Changed:
1. **Removed Prisma completely** - No more Prisma client, schema, or migrations
2. **Implemented raw SQL queries** - All database operations now use direct PostgreSQL queries
3. **Updated all controllers** - Auth, Task, Project, Subscription controllers now use new query system
4. **Created database utilities** - New connection pooling and query functions
5. **Updated environment configuration** - Added Supabase-specific environment variables
6. **Created setup scripts** - Database setup and seeding scripts for easy initialization
7. **Updated documentation** - Comprehensive guides for the new setup

#### New Database Structure:
- **Connection**: PostgreSQL with Supabase hosting
- **Queries**: Raw SQL with parameterized queries for security
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized for performance and scalability
- **Triggers**: Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- **Indexes**: Performance-optimized database indexes

#### Benefits of Migration:
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Removed Prisma dependency, reduced package size
- **Better Control**: Direct SQL queries provide more control over database operations
- **Supabase Integration**: Native integration with Supabase features
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and connection pooling
- **Scalability**: Better suited for production deployment

### Current Environment Status
- ✅ Successfully migrated from Prisma to Supabase PostgreSQL
- ✅ All controllers updated to use raw SQL queries
- ✅ Database setup and seeding scripts implemented
- ✅ Environment configuration updated for Supabase
- ✅ Documentation updated with new setup instructions
- ✅ Successfully implemented task list and detail views
- ✅ Successfully added calendar view for tasks
- ✅ Successfully implemented natural language task input component
- ✅ Successfully added email notification system
- ✅ Successfully integrated Stripe for subscription management
- ✅ Successfully implemented rate limiting and security enhancements
- ✅ Successfully added structured logging system
- ✅ Successfully implemented mock API system for offline development
- ✅ Successfully fixed encoding issues in dashboard and other files
- ✅ Successfully fixed authentication with test account functionality

### Environment Configuration Required:
- **DATABASE_URL**: Supabase PostgreSQL connection string
- **SUPABASE_URL**: Your Supabase project URL
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY**: Your Supabase service key
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for JWT tokens
- **JWT_EXPIRES_IN**: JWT token expiration time
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: OpenAI API key for NLP features
- **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: Stripe secret key for payments
- **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET**: Stripe webhook secret
- **Email configuration**: SMTP settings for notifications
- **APP_URL**: Application URL
- **ENABLE_SCHEDULER**: Enable/disable scheduled jobs

### Database Setup Commands:
```bash
# Set up database tables
npm run db:setup

# Seed with test data
npm run db:seed

# Drop all tables (development only)
npm run db:setup drop
```
